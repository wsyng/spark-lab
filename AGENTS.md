# Spark Lab — Agent Onboarding

Welcome to Spark Lab. Here's how to get started.

## First Steps

1. Run `bd prime` to load session context from `.beads/PRIME.md`
2. Run `bd ready` to see what's available to work on
3. Pick an issue and run `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
4. Do the work, commit often
5. When done: `bd close <id>` and update `.beads/PRIME.md`
6. Run `bd sync` before ending your session

## Conventions

- Commit messages should be clear and concise
- One issue at a time — finish or park before picking up another
- Update PRIME.md at the end of every session so the next agent has context
- Keep it simple — this is a lab, not a production system

## Project Structure

This project is in its early stages. Structure will emerge as we build.
